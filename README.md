# Synchronous
This project demonstrates five different approaches to handle synchronous operations - when you need the result in the same calling method now, instead of a different delegate method later. The five approaches are:
- State Variable
- Return Value
- In-Out Parameter
- Completion Handler
- VIP Cycle
