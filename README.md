# Synchronous
This project demonstrates five different approaches to handle synchronous operations - when you need the result in the same calling method now, instead of a different delegate method later. The five approaches are: 1. State Variable, 2.Return Value, 3. In-Out Parameter, 4. Completion Handler, and 5. VIP Cycle.
